# Evaluate Sentence-Transformer Models for Semantic Search Engine

This repository is dedicated to evaluating Sentence-Transformer models optimized for use within a semantic search engine. Our goal is to fine-tune and assess various Sentence-Transformer models to enhance the relevancy and accuracy of search results in semantic search with Amazon OpenSearch.

## Overview

Semantic search engines use understanding beyond keyword matching to interpret the intent and contextual meaning of search queries. By leveraging Sentence-Transformer models, we aim to significantly improve the search experience, offering users more accurate, context-aware results.
